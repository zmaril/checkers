#############################################################################
# The binary trees used in the tournament routines are stored in
# python as dictionaries (another term for a hash table). Every node
# in the tree gets a number which corresponds to the index of the leaf
# in the output of "run". The python dictionary is a mapping whose
# input is the node number and the output is the pair of nodes
# directly above it. The "maketree" routine constructs this dictionary
# using the following method.

# The "run" algorithm prefers a certain direction in the tree. A node,
# say m (>1) corresponds with a leaf if you start at node m, go right
# once, then go left until the leaf. The 1st node, or root,
# corresponds to the 1st leaf; i.e. by starting at node 1 and only
# taking left branches, you will reach the 1st zero.

# To understand the algorithm, one needs to understand how the input
# determines the tree structure. As an example, take
# [1,1,2,3,3,3]. This indicates that as you travel from the first node
# to the first leaf (as always, in the default direction) two nodes
# are encountered, hence [1,1]. These are the splits from the checker
# game. Then you backtrack to the nearest node and call it 2. As you
# head to the second leaf from 2, you encounter one split, as
# indicated by [2].  Last, you backtrack to the nearest node and call
# it 3. Then [3,3,3] indicates that 3 splits are encountered. Any
# unfinished nodes go directly to leaves, and are numbered in order as
# you backtrack through the tree.

# For the "maketree" algorithm, consider [1,1,1,2,3,3,4,7,7] as
# input. It helps to draw this tree by hand to compare what the
# algorithm is doing. As the input has 9 entries, there will be 9
# nodes; 10 including the root node. Furthermore, each node can only
# be accessed from below by one node, so each node except the root
# will be in the image of exactly one node. So we make a pool of
# integers from 1 to 10 (note *1 below.) The input tells us that
# nothing branches to the right of nodes 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, so by hand
# we might begin by making these keys and pointing them to zero
# (*2). Node 7 has splits (2 of them), so we look at the two entries
# after 7 in the pool of nodes, (*3) and a little thought shows that 7
# must point to 9 and 9 must point to 8 (both on the left this time.)
# Continue this procedure by using the largest nodes from the pool
# first to fill in the rest of the tree.
